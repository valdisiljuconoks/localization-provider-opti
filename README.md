# How to Contribute

It's super cool if you read this section and are interested how to help the library. Forking and playing around sample application is the fastest way to understand how the localization provider is working and how to get started.

Forking and cloning the repo is the first step you do. Keep in mind that the provider is split into couple of repositories to keep things separated. Additional repos are pulled in as submodules. If you Git client does not support automatic checkout of the submodules, just execute this command at the root of the checkout directory:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:valdisiljuconoks/localization-provider-epi.git
```

**NB!** As Optimizely repository contains 2 level (`lib/netcore` and `lib/netcore/lib/localization-provider`) submodules `--recursive-submodules` sometimes fails to detect 2nd level module. Then you can just step into `netcore` submodule folder and execute pull command there:

```
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```
